## Digital Bacillaria
We [participated](https://github.com/devoworm/Digital-Bacillaria/issues) in Hacktoberfest 2021!  Interested in participating? Attend a [group meeting](https://devoworm.weebly.com/schedulejoin.html).

_Bacillaria_ is a diatom genus in the [Bacillariaceae family](http://tolweb.org/Bacillariaceae/125684). [Diatoms](http://tolweb.org/Diatoms/) are a group of [Eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) microorganisms composed of cells with silica walls and that exhibit a unique life-history [1].

## Species
We are working with images from the species _Bacillaria paradoxa_, also known as _Bacillaria paxillifer_ [2].

### Description of _Bacillaria_
Cells (called filaments) are elongated and motile, sliding along each other, in stacked colonies. Cells are rectangular in side view. Two large plate-like chloroplasts are present, one near each end of the cell. The nucleus is located centrally. Cells are yellow-brown in color [1].

The stacked colony moves by pairs of individual cells sliding against each other. This synchronized movement [4] is like an accordian in that the displacement ripples across the extent of the colony and results in large positional changes. This results in cyclic gliding movements resulting from the action of actin filament motors [5]. The primary movement pattern also has a number of interesting properties, including the potential for explosive kinetics resulting from [higher-order derivatives of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)#Higher_derivatives).


### Example of Model-building for Deep Learning
In this example, we used a mathematical model to define features in a library of microscopy movies, which allowed us to define features for [extraction by a pre-trained model (DeepLabv3)](https://github.com/devoworm/Digital-Bacillaria/blob/master/Tutorials/TensorFlow-using-DeepLab.md). From this, we were able to create digital models of _Bacillaria_ cells for further analysis.

This mathematical model used five points on each cell to define a bounding box:

* The two ends of the cell (1 and 2).

* The midpoint of the line formed between 1 and 2 (3).

* The edges of a cell (4 and 5) defined by drawing a line perpendicular to the axis defined by points 1, 2, and 3.

### Using digital data to understand biology
One of our goals is to use the data extracted from microscopy images to better understand biological processes such as the movement of a _Bacillaria_ colony. One such example that has been conducted with coarse-grained phenotypic models is to model the hydrodynamics of filament movement through the water column [6].
